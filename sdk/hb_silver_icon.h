/*
 * hb_silver_icon.h — serve custom home-screen icon bitmaps at runtime.
 *
 * Springboard bitmaps resolve through a disk-backed, id-range-limited cache
 * (loads from the on-disk image db at boot), so a novel id in the resource
 * chain is never consulted. But the cache calls a single "alternate resolver"
 * for in-range ids that have no on-disk data (empty slots). We install our own
 * alternate resolver: for ids present in a packed bitmap blob (the format the
 * ipodhax tool produces, which is byte-identical to the cache's in-memory
 * bitmap header), we hand back a pointer to our bitmap; everything else falls
 * through to the original resolver.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *  - The blob's ids must be EMPTY IN-RANGE cache slots (no on-disk bitmap), so
 *    ref-counting lands on an empty entry and never frees our buffer.
 *  - The blob must stay resident; pass its base address.
 *  - Call on the UI task (e.g. from the home-controller hook), after the blob
 *    is in memory and before/at icon registration.
 *
 * Addresses are for iPod nano 7 OS 1.1.2 (see hb_silver_icon.c for derivation).
