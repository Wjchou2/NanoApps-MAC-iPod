/*
 * hb_heap.h — the OS main heap (OS memory allocator).
 *
 * Homebrew shares the live OS heap. Two ways in:
 *   - the heap allocator (0x0842d444) panics when the allocation fails.
 *     A too-large request reboots the device. Never probe with it.
 *   - The nothrow allocator (0x0842b440) underneath returns NULL
 *     on failure. hb_os_alloc() wraps it, so you can request optimistically and
 *     handle NULL.
 *
 * Use sparingly and free promptly — holding megabytes starves the OS (compositor,
 * etc.). The free-size queries are pure reads (no allocation), safe to call any
 * time, e.g. to size a buffer before grabbing it.
