/*
 * hb_silver_res.h — serve custom resources (labels, icons, layouts) to the
 * stock UI by id, and add custom home-screen items, at runtime.
 *
 * The stock UI resolves every label/image/layout by a 4-char type + numeric
 * id, looked up through a per-task chain of resource databases. These helpers
 * (a) parse a flattened resource-DB blob (the format the OS resource system reads
 * and writes), (b) splice it into that chain so its ids resolve everywhere,
 * and (c) register a home-screen item that references ids by number.
 *
 * All of these MUST run on the UI task (e.g. from a home-controller vtable
 * hook); they touch OS UI singletons and lists directly — must run on the UI task.
 *
 * Addresses are for iPod nano 7 OS 1.1.2.
