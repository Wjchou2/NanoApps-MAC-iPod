/*
 * hb_silver_uitask.h — run resident code on the UI task by hooking an OS
 * class-method slot.
 *
 * The home/menu controller's action-dispatch method runs on the UI task,
 * which is where mutating UI-owned singletons, the home grid, and the
 * resource chain is safe (these must run on the UI task). Patch that slot to point at
 * your own function and it will run in that context on every dispatch; forward
 * the calls you don't consume to the original.
 *
 * hb_silver_uitask_hook patches one method pointer in a class vtable, flushes
 * the I-cache over it, and returns the previous pointer (the original method).
